"""
Rigorous Evaluation Test Suite for Codette Phase 6

This test suite answers:
1. Is Codette actually better than baseline?
2. Does Phase 6 provide measurable improvement over Phase 1-5?
3. Is the system gaming coherence (high Γ but low accuracy)?
4. Do individual Phase 6 components add value?

Test Strategy:
- 25 questions spanning physics, ethics, consciousness, creativity, systems
- Run each through 4 conditions (Baseline, Phase 1-5, Phase 6 Full, Phase 6 -PreFlight)
- Measure: correctness, reasoning_depth, coherence_score, calibration
- Detect: false consensus, adapter convergence, coherence-accuracy divergence
