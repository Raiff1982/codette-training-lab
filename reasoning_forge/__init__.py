"""
Reasoning Forge - Multi-Agent Reasoning Training Data Generator

The reasoning forge takes concepts and generates high-quality multi-perspective
reasoning training data. Each agent analyzes from its unique perspective, a critic
evaluates the ensemble, and a synthesis engine combines them into coherent training examples.

New in v2.0:
  - EpistemicMetrics: RC+xi tension/coherence measurement
  - QuantumSpiderweb: 5D belief propagation + attractor detection
  - CocoonSync: Federated encrypted state synchronization
  - ForgeEngine.forge_with_feedback(): Closed critic loop
  - ForgeEngine.forge_with_debate(): Multi-turn agent debate
